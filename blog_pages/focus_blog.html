  <h1>focus & what it means to me</h1>

  <p>I made my first instagram account back in 9th grade, through my mum's phone, back then she could control and monitor my instagram usage but now that i am a grown-up adult , i find myself checking instagram, whatsapp , i-messages with each notification , or doomscrolling through endless shallow content. It made me realize , if everything is free to consume, is my attention/focus the price/stake? I honestly think my ability to get into deep work or the ability to be in a deep work state(often refered to as flow) has seriously been distorted. </p>

  <p>I feel half of  my overwhelmed/anxious behaviour equates to me being easily available to such platforms , or being hyper communicative to friends & family. Having finished my midterm examinations recently , i happen to notice that ability to fall into deep work/flow incrementally increases if there is an urgency(eg: an exam tomorrow), and i feel i could use this super-power of urgency to empower me back to a sharper state of mind. If I know what I am  working on, why I am working on it, when it needs to be done, and how exactly to get it done, i immediately become focused. So some practices i shall be incorporating would be:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dividing my day in three blocks based on my circadian rythm, mornings for production, afternoons for learning, evenings for reflection.</li>
        <li>Taking on the huge tasks/challenging tasks before everything</li>
        <li>Breaking Up with social platforms like instagram/ youtube shorts and substack</li>
        <li>Practicing mindfulness or meditation to improve concentration through art of living</li>
        <li>Progressively challenging myself with  healthy mental and physical tasks(similar to progressive overload in gym) </li>
        <li>This list is partial and i'd be updating as i test twhat works and what doesnt</li>
