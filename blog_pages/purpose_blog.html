  <h1>Pursuit of Purpose</h1>

  <p>I recently watched a movie called Lakshya(directed by Farhan Akhtar) and started questioning my purpose, values and responsibility.At the moment , at a  young age of 21 i believe the next 10 years of my life would decide my economic, social mobility throughout the chain. But how do it do it? How do some figures like Steve Jobs, Sam Altman move with so conviction in their purpose at such a young age witth little guidance. Is it their vision, or are they too comfortable with the uncertainity that lies ahead?   </p>

  <p>Growing up in a Marwadi household in an industrial town near Ajanta Caves, i was always fascinated with entreprenurship, finance and technology.This fascination felt as essential to me as my senses when i moved to the US for undergrad. Downtown Atlanta was booming with entreprenurship, in freshman year i heard some kids from Gatech dropping out to pursue their dorm-grown startup and i simply followed their actions- building projects , learning customer behaviors and most importantly networking.I throughly enjoyed this process the next three years until i interned at this insanely cool startup called Overwatch Data. </p>

  <p>This internship experience was the most fruitful experiences i had in a long time, the culture was incredibly inspiring , people were insanely smart(for a ref:my manager was Forbes 30U30), and that left me more hungry to build myself. The real question lies in how i could build something so rare and irreplacable that capitalism rewards me not only in economic standpoint but also socially.</p>
  
  <p>Well i am yet to figure out my purpose, much more to say i am yet figure out the course of direction and the only thing i can do is to not steer in the wrong direction.I'd like to devote the next 3 years in building perseverance, values, mental strength, technical skills and  entreprenurial skills which would help me in tougher times that lie ahead.</p>
